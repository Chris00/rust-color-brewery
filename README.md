Color brewery
=============

This crate define colors palettes an provide a searchable access to
find those matching some criteria.  In particular, it contains all the
palettes of Matplotlib and of [ColorBrewer][] designed by the
cartographer Cynthia A.Â Brewer to assist mapmakers in choosing
appropriate color schemes.  As a convenience, color gradients based on
those palettes are also implemented.

The default representation of colors is the one given by the [rgb
crate][] but any type can be used: it suffices it implements the
`RGBColor` trait.
